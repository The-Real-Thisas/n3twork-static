Kobe Bryant was the epitome of modern sports alpha. To him, every game played was meant to be won. He simply didn’t play to make friends, instead, he kept an edge that made him carry the weight of every game upon his shoulders. In his two decades as the fearsome soul of the beloved Lakers, he won Los Angeles’ everlasting adoration, and he was revered by basketball fans from every corner of the world with a hoop and a dream, including his native Philadelphia and his other childhood home in Italy.

Bryant, the 18-time All-Star who won five NBA titles became one of the best basketball players of his generation in a 20-year career with the Lakers, died in a helicopter accident on January 26, 2020. The collision happened in the foggy hills above Calabasas, California, approximately 30 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. News of Bryant’s death prompted an outburst of sadness around the sporting community and beyond, but it was especially deeply felt in Los Angeles, where Bryant was undoubtedly the city’s best athlete and one of its most cherished people. Buildings from downtown to Los Angeles International Airport were lit in Lakers purple and gold.

Bryant has been a basketball sensation for his entire adult life and has evolved from a youth to a valued veteran in the brutal Hollywood spotlight. Throughout his sporting career, Bryant went on to be amongst the most influential NBA players and even the voice of the Lakers. Winning a record four NBA All-Star Game MVP honors, he was the overall MVP league in 2008 and a two-time NBA scoring leader, but also received 12 NBA All-Defensive Team picks. A two-time Olympic gold medalist on a dominant U.S. team, Bryant retired in 2016, scoring 60 points in his last NBA game. However, he did not stop there. Shortly after leaving the Lakers, he started a production studio, claiming he was just as excited about storytelling as he was about his sport. He received an Oscar in 2018 for his contributions to “Dear Basketball,” an animated film about his relationship with the game.

Kobe Bryant influenced a generation of basketball players all over the world with exquisite talents and unquenchable, competitive energy. His influential persona was not only because of the trophies, medals that were stacked but rather because of the humbleness and kindness he radiated. In most of his interviews, he would not mention how many titles he would win, or MVP’s, but he’d discuss how he did all he could out of the chance he was given. Most importantly, he’d encourage the youth and his fans to do the same, have the courage to grasp opportunities as they are endless if only we strive to attain them.
